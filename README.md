<h2>HAR HAR MAHADEV</h2> 
This Python script uses OpenCV and Turtle to draw an outline of an image, specifically 'mahadev.jpg'. It processes the image to create a binary outline using adaptive thresholding and then utilizes Turtle graphics to trace this outline. The script finds the closest points to move the turtle for a smooth drawing, ensuring it skips large jumps to maintain the outline shape. The final output is a visual representation of the image's outline drawn using Turtle.
